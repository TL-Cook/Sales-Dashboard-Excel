## ðŸ§  What I Learned

I built this with no prior experience in pivot tables or dashboards. This was my first hands-on Excel project, and it sparked my interest in data tools like Python and BI platforms. From this I am also able to send the Sales Manager any YTD data they want within minutes for these metrics.
